Basically, you can signup at the site, the data is going to be retrieve at the data base mySQLdatabase and you can login and logout. It was built with an user authentication system, the Django system installed the auth in its apps and I added this to my project to avoid people that are not logged in to vote. Is possible to reset your password and sign in again. You can see the homepage after logged in at this home page you can click at the vote that is going to bring you to the vote page and you can choose to vote, see the results and choose to leave or vote again. If you are logged in as an administrator you can see the available functions like adding or changing groups, users and questions. The project has a certain complexity where it is possible to create operations such as read, update and delete.
